# Permits
A management system for remembering numberplates for digital permitting.

This webapp runs directly from github using the source code you can see here. 

All data is stored in your browser's localstorage, so your data won't be remembered between devices, however, you can export the data from one device and import it to another.

Use the app at https://lindymad.github.io/permits/
